Abstract: 

Familial hypercholanemia-1 (FHCA1) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by elevated concentrations of bile acids, itching, and fat malabsorption. Here we report a male patient with the unusual combination of high bile acids, itchiness and hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, he was whole-exome sequenced and it revealed be homozygous to an nonsynonymous SNV at the TJP2 gene, that is a cause of FHCA1. 

Abstract of the used pipeline: 

Whole-Exome Next-Generation Sequencing Reveals a Mutation in TJP2;

WES identified 22,668 variants in coding regions, of which 21,344 have coverage greater than or equal to 10, genotype quality greater than or equal to 30, and allelic balance greater than or equal to 0.20. Then 10,793 were nonsynonymous variants. Finally we got 661 variants after filtering the frequency of the alternative allele less than or equal to 0.01. Subsequently we look for a recessive disease model obtaining 11 variants, among which was a predicted deleterious nonsynonymous SNV (c.T155C) at the exon 3 of the TJP2 gene that is located at 9q21.11.
Although the above variant coincide with the symptoms, we briefly look for heterozygous, heterozygous compound and linked to X diseases models, but none of the symptoms coincided with the variants.
